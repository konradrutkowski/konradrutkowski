### Mitt Spor - Bluetooth IoT for Dog Tracking
I'm currently working on the Mitt Spor project, an innovative Bluetooth IoT solution for dog tracking and monitoring. This project involves real-time location tracking, activity level monitoring, and geofence alerts to ensure the safety and well-being of pets. By integrating with DyreID's national pet database, Mitt Spor provides enhanced security and peace of mind for pet owners.
